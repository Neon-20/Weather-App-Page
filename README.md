# Weather-App/Page
This is a very basic project based on predicting weather conditions of a particular place showing::
Latitude,Longitude,Temperature,Humidity,Pressure of that particular place.
In this project I have basically used HTML to make webpage structure, CSS for making style and nodejs as well. Also i have used a public free api to import
data from a particular website named: []{https://weatherstack.com/}
Thank you!!
